COGS 121 Assignment 2 - Spring 2015
===========

This project implements the following design principles:

* Loading icons are implemented for all visualizations that may require an AJAX call. This is to keep the user 
informed about the progress of the loading of the visualization.
* Buttons are large and clear to allow users to easily click on the buttons. The whole button area accepts clicks 
rather than just the text.
* Different colors are used sparingly to denote different data.
* System location/status is displayed in the top navigation bar.
